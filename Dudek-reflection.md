# Dudek Reflection

    * What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
        I was struggling with how to go back into a local repo and keep working on it after it had been uploaded to GitHub. I still have a few questions, but I think I understand more of the proper Git workflow, so even though I have to experiment and troubleshoot during the process, I am having success in the end.
    * What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
        Definitely how to manage branches, and how to choose which one to work on. I learned that it is better so just start a new branch instead of going back to work on a new one. I also feel like I have the three steps to commit down.
    * What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
        I had one specific question for the guide Neal about how to insert an inline picture in markdown. He was very helpful.
    * What still confuses you about Git?
        I think I'm still a little confused about switching back and forth between the local repo and the Github repo, but it is becoming more and more clear.
    * How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
        It was great! Both the guide and my partner were friendly and helpful.
